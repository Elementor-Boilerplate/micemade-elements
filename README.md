**Frequently Asked Questions**

* Does it work with the theme that I am using ?

Our tests indicate that the widgets work well with most themes that are well coded. You may need some minor custom CSS with themes that hijack the styling for heading tags by using !important keyword. Best use with theme's full width page templates, or use Elementor canvas page template.

* Will this plugin be available in wordpress.org ?

Time will tell. When we estimate plugin has enough added functionalities to Elementor, or some other reason, it will be available on wp.org. So far, install it from GitHub (Download zip or clone the repository) .
